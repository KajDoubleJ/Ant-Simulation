# AntSimulation

This is my first team University project. We were one the first year and the name of the course was Objected Programming. 
Our task was to create symulation program, wich couldn't be interactive by user.
The main goal of this project was to learn how to implement objected oriented concepts and principles.

The AntSimulation shows how the ants live. There is special hierachy of the ants: queen, warriors, and the workers.
There are not only the ants, in the anthill live some sponges wich steal the food. Every ant has special way to live.
Workers are collecting the food to the depot, warriors attack sponges and the queen is producing new ants.
The queen can produce workers and warriors. Every ant has to eat, if ant won't eat, it wil die.
The queen eats the food from depot. The queen has special place, where she produces the ants. She's moving only when she need food.

Food is settled in random fields. It's very importand for warriors to protect the food form sponges. When there won't be any food,
population will decrease.

The anthill is made by rocks. Ants can't move to the field when there is a rock.
What is more, rocks are settled randomly outside the anthill.

The simulation ends after determined number of iterations or when the queen die. 
At the and user can check the statistics in the "statistics.txt" file.

Symbols in the visualization: Queen-Q, Warrior-W, Worker-A, Sponge-S, Food-F, Rock-R

The amount of time was limited, so in the and we had critical remarks to our project. There are couple things that we wanted to change.
First of all we should have improved the hermetization.
Also we were planing to make graphics for all objects in the map.
The number of our ideas to make new functions seemed to be infinity.

What should we make better? We are open to comments. Please send Your remarks to the email: k.olbryt@gmail.com
